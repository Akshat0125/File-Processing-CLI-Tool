# 📂 File Processing CLI Tool

A high-performance Rust command-line application for efficient file parsing and concurrent data processing. This project highlights real-world **systems programming**, **async Rust**, and **memory-safe concurrency**, built with production-grade practices to appeal directly to recruiters.

## 🚀 Overview

The File Processing CLI Tool processes multiple input files concurrently using asynchronous I/O. It is designed with a strong focus on **performance, scalability, and reliability**, demonstrating practical experience with Rust’s ownership model, async/await workflows, and clean modular design.

## ✨ Key Highlights

- Built in **Rust** with a focus on safety, performance, and reliability  
- Uses **Tokio** for asynchronous file I/O and concurrent execution  
- Handles multiple files simultaneously without blocking operations  
- Implements memory-safe concurrency using async/await  
- Parses and serializes structured data using **Serde**  
- Strong error handling with meaningful, user-friendly messages  
- Outputs processed results in structured **JSON format**  
- Designed as a real-world CLI tool, not a toy project
